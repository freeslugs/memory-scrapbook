# About This Document

## Methodology
For the first three levels of the curriculum, we will finish each day with deliverables for everyone’s individual project ideas. Since we will also cover parts of the process after the prototype has been built, we’ve included a sample project to use for activities on the fourth day.

# Level 1: Planning
A lot of discussion, sticky notes, and Googling go into building a product long before the product is actually built. Below we’ll introduce a few separate ideas that come together when researching the problem and the space in which we’re building a product. 

After today, we’ll each have a product idea with a rough business model sketched out using the Lean Canvas. In the next level, we’ll then design the features and corresponding methods of implementation based on the business model.

## 1.1 Product Life Cycle
While software companies might define their product development cycles differently, there are generally three main steps involved:

Planning -- Based on the company’s missions and values, market research, competitor landscape, and user needs, let’s identify the specific problem and how to solve it
Design -- Drawing from current user pain points for other competing products, let’s create a refreshing and enriching user experience that matches with our product’s value proposition
Implementation -- We build out the product according to our plans and re-prioritize adjustments as a larger scale of user feedback rolls in 

In today’s part of the curriculum, we’ll take a look at various ways research is conducted as part of the planning stage. Afterwards, we’ll apply what we’ve learned to a case study of Snapchat, one of today’s hot consumer apps out there.

## 1.2 Market Validation

<a id="defining-market-validation"></a>
### 1.2.1 Defining Market Validation
Market validation is the process of gauging your target market’s interest in your product. 
If you can hypothetically sell it before you build it, you will have saved yourself a lot of time from spending hours on a product only to find out users are not interested in it.

Before building a product, it’s important to define who your users/customers are to make sure what you create would be relevant to your audience. A few questions to consider:
-	What is the problem we’re trying to solve?
-	Who are the users and customers? Customers won’t always be the same as your users.
-	What would the target market be willing to pay / how can the product be profitable?
-	Who would our competitors be, and what are their strengths / weaknesses?

### 1.2.2 Snapchat Case Study Part I
What problem does Snapchat design a solution for?
-	"Snapchat isn't about capturing the traditional Kodak moment. It's about communicating with the full range of human emotion — not just what appears to be pretty or perfect."
-	"Emergency detagging of Facebook photos before job interviews and photoshopping blemishes out of candid shots before they hit the internet" [source]
